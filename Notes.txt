These notes are for the Custom Clan Helper mod:

SaveManager.TrackRunResults(); -> Perhaps allow card masteries?
SaveManager.GetRunType().AllowAdvancedProgression() <- This prevents masteries. Maybe make exception for custom cards?
SaveManager.TrackCardWins() -> Filter for custom cards only.
MetagameSaveData.IncrementWinStreak(); -> Don't do this.
MetagameSaveData.TrackSpChallengeWin(); -> ALso, no.
SaveManager.TrackCardWins() -> Should be okay to mess with this.
