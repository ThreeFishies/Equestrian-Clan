"The end is neigh, as they say it. Hell is all but destroyed, and in my desperation to save the last remaining shard of the pyre, I've brought the Boneshaker to a wild land of magic and little, colorful ponies. They're friendly and all, but are they really cut out to be champions of Hell? It's with great reluctance that I recruit them to my cause, but I have no other choice. The Seraph doomed us all when he extinguished the fires of Hell. The pyre must be rekindled, no matter the cost." --Rebel from Heaven's army, in service of the greater good.

With tiny units and a new over-stacking mechanic, the Equestrain clan focuses on piling as many units as possible onto a single floor and using party-wide spells to support them. The more units that you can stack together, the more powerful they can become, and the stronger the magic will be that you have access to.

This clan was designed for use with the DLC content, but does not require it. Please note that features that require the DLC, such as unit synthesis, will be unavailable without it.

Notes:

Any custom clan is a significant addition to the game. This *will* result in increased loading times. Please be patient, as it can take some time to round up all the little ponies and send them to Hell!

Equestrian mutators have colorful borders to help distinguish them. Mutators are sorted in alphabetical order, while the new expert challenges are added to the end of the list. Expert challenges are unlocked at covenant level 25. Check the patch notes for a full list of changes.

To make the most of the Equestrian card mastery frames, please remember to also install the Custom Clan Helper mod, as that will enable you to master Equestrian cards. If you're having trouble locating the elusive Missing Mare to unlock them, look up her entry in the GitHub source code (linked below) for answers.
