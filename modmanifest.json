    "ChangeLog": "Version 1.1.0:\n\n * Bug fix: Fixed a tooltip error with Heart's Desire.\n\n * Clarified that Heart's Desire and Poison Joke do not trigger Rally effects. (They never did, but now it says so.)\n\n * New mutator: Scrapbook. You can no longer skip for money.\n\n New mutator: Dendrophilia. Start with the Bloomberg relic (all unit drafts gain a largestone).\n\n * New mutator: Unstable Matter. 33% chance that your units explode when played, dealing 50 damage to everyone.\n\n * New Mutator: No Respite. An extra wave spawns before minor bosses.\n\n * New mutator: Want It Need It. All spells gain Holdover.\n\n * New Mutator: Equalizer. When you play a spell, each different spell in hand is consumed and replaced by a copy of that spell.\n\n* New Expert Challenge: Hoarding. 'You get twice the rewards and can't skip but at least your lads are like trees.'\n\n * New Expert Challenge: One Trick Pony. 'Your foes are unrelenting and you're stuck in a rut.'\n\n\n\n *** Balance Adjustments ***\n\n * Background Pony base health reduced to 12 from 15. Essence unchanged.\n\n * Jestember essence redesigned. It now gives +10 attack and immunities to Emberdrain and Sap.\n\n * Guardian of the Gates essence stats reduced to +60 hp, +20 attack, Multistrike 1, +3 size; from +75 hp, +25 attack, Multistrike 1, +3 size. \n\n * Mare You Know essence adjusted. Bonus stats removed and replaced with Sap 8. The resolve trigger of drawing a card and reducing the cost remains unchanged.\n\n * Tweaked the dialog for the refusal option on the Flower Pony cavern event. This event also appears slightly less frequently.",
