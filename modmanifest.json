    "ChangeLog": "Version 1.2.3:\n\n * Performed some back-end code cleanup, retiring some functions that are now handled by Trainworks and are no longer necessary. This includes unit essence fallbacks and the pony depiler.\n\n * Changed localization initialization so the function is now only called once.\n\n * Added status effect icons to tooltips.\n\n * Fixed a bug that removed the pact shard cost of duplicating a unit with an Equestrian essence.\n\n * Equestrian champions are no longer incorrectly flagged as banner units.",
