    "ChangeLog": "Version 1.0.0:\n\n * Equestrian card mastery frames have been added! Find the lost soul, Missing Mare, to unlock them.\n\n * Added a toggle for the 'Give Pony' button on the Main Menu screen.\n\n * Updated the description of the exile champion's 'Lucid' path to clarify that the ember gain is each turn.\n\n * Tweaked the clan's initialization so that a background image can be displayed during the loading process.\n\n * Updated artwork on the 'Friendstone' to be more consistent with other common unit upgrades.\n\n * The 'Give Pony' button will now relocate with the 'Move Battle UI' mod.\n\n * Bug fix: The pony depiler garbage collection utility will no longer destroy Arcadian character assets.\n\n * Bug fix: Exiting the game or returning to the main menu from the map screen will no longer cause Frank to forget what items were in the steel shop if a custom clan upgrade was on display.\n\n * Workaround: Likewise, custom clan banners will no longer cause a softlock in that situation. The behaviour is not perfect, however, as they can erroneously regenerate.",
